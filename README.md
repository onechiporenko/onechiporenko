Also I've created a fake server with ability to auto generate a lot of linked data items and tools to work with it. [Swarm Host Platform](https://github.com/onechiporenko/swarm-host-platform) is a monorepo with server, DB and CLI. [Swarm Host UI](https://github.com/onechiporenko/swarm-host-ui) - separated UI to work with data in the DB (used for CRUD operations).
