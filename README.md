Long time ago (2-3 years) I've created a fake server with ability to auto generate a lot of linked data items and a tools to work with it. [Swarm Host](https://github.com/onechiporenko/swarm) - server itself, [Lair DB](https://github.com/onechiporenko/lair) - "DB" under the hood, [Swarm Host CLI](https://github.com/onechiporenko/swarm-host-cli) - CLI to work with Swarm Host, [Swarm Host UI](https://github.com/onechiporenko/swarm-host-ui) - separated UI to work with data in the DB (used for CRUD operations).
